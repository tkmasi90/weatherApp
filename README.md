# Programming 3 - Group Project - Weather App

## The app can be used to search for the weather based on location name. The app uses OpenWeather API.
## Incules a map tab, which uses leaflet and OpenStreetMap API

## Documentation
- PDF - In the folder "Documentation"
- Javadocs - In the folder "Javadoc"

## My Contribution
- Most of the UI implementation, excluding the map tab.
- Back end implementation of some weather class data.
- Parts of the Documentation.

## Environment
Movie Night Planner is a basic NetBeans application. A relatively recent version (e.g., 20+) can be used to build and run the application.

*Example Windows configuration:*

Product Version: Apache NetBeans IDE 20

Java: 21.0.1; OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 21.0.1+12-LTS

Runtime: OpenJDK Runtime Environment 21.0.1+12-LTS

System: Windows 11 version 10.0 running on amd64; UTF-8; en_US (nb)

## Git Branching Strategy
- One permanent branch: main
- Ephemeral feature branches area created from the main branch. Branches and merge requests should be created using GitLab Web UI via the issue board. This ensures that the branch names contain automatically both, the issue number and the title.

## UPDATE: OpenWeather modified their API, and now the App won't launch unfortunately, even with correct API key.
